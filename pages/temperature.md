# Temperature

The data in the following charts is extracted every 20 minutes from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/). 

```sql temperature_latest_measurements
with

base as (

select
    measured_at at time zone 'utc' at time zone 'europe/berlin' as measured_at,
    location_name,

    temperature
from analytics.fct_weather

)

select *

{#each temperature_latest_measurements as measurement}

- The current temperature in <Value data={measurement} column=location_name/> is <Value data={measurement} column=temperature/>Â°C orders at <Value data={measurement} column=measured_at fmt=hms/>.
